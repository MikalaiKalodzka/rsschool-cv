## About myself
    My primary goal is to become Juniour Developer by the end of the next year. I am interested in developing the 
	necessary set of skills in order to achive my goal. My main interest direction is front-end 
	development. The reason why I am interested in this kind of development is simple: many times I have had
	to look for some application that could make easier certain aspect of my life. Unfortunately not
	always I had found exactly what I was looking for. Eventually an idea came to me that if I
	not able to find what I need than I should do it myself. But first of all I have to learn how to realize it.
